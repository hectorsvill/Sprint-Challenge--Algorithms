#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) 0(n) - linear time
    The algorithim has a liniear time complexity because the time increases in porportion to the input n.


b) 0(n^2) - quadratic time
    The algorithim needs to perfrom a linear opearation for each input value n so it has quadratic time complexity.

c)

## Exercise II
